        <h1>Where it began?</h1> 
        <p>It began when I was 14 years old at that time, and the old me was seeking how I could install photoshop freely on my laptop.
          <br>And as you guys thought, I got ransomware; Crypto ransomware as I remembered on my laptop because I tried to find the crack version.
          <br>I got panic but I was dumb kiddo, so of course I had no idea what should I do and the story ended when I decided to reinstall my windows with full of fear.
        <p>
        <p>Since that, my curiousity about tech has grown from time to time and My journey has begun...</p>
